# Doubly Linked List in Java

This repository contains basic implementations of **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** operations in Java. A doubly linked list allows traversal in both forward and backward directions with the help of `next` and `prev` pointers.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

### 1. `InsertatBeginningDeleteatEndandDisplay.java`

Implements the following operations:
- **Insert at Beginning**: Adds a new node to the head of the list.
- **Delete at End**: Removes the last node from the list.
- **Display**: Traverses and prints the list from head to tail.

### 2. `InsertBeginningDeleteBeginning.java`

Implements:
- **Insert at Beginning**: Adds a new node to the head of the list.
- **Delete at Beginning**: Removes the first node from the list.
- **Display**: Shows the list contents in order.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Object-oriented approach using Java classes.
- Easy to follow structure for academic learning and practice.
- Handles edge cases (e.g., empty list, single-node deletion).
- Clean and modular code for extending with more features.
